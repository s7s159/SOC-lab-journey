# TryHackMe | Introduction to Phishing
This is like a real life scenario where i deal with alerts and finish them all.
Today i finished 4 alerts within 15 minutes due to first time trying to understand TryHackMe environment.
Three alerts were True Positive because there was an email sending phising URLs and when i do analyze URLs with analyzer tool it says malicious.
Last alert was false positive because the analyzer tool said it is safe and after it we should make users more aware to avoid these phising emails and we should do host scan if it needs.
